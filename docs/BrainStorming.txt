What is the theme?
* Asyncrhronous Board Game
* Post-human robot world.
* Escaping an abondoned space ship/colony.
* Stealth vs. Combat
	* Cameras (Non-panning)
	* Other Robots
* Hacking terminals and other robots (Simple dice roll, not mini-game)

What is the purpose?
* Gather enough energy to escape the dungeon
* Fight other robots
* Get loot
* Upgrade abilities
* Fight a boss at the top or bottom level
* Procedural generation of rooms 
	Room layout based on grammars (permute a finite number of room types based on constraints)

Building Generation
	-Madlib style input for contraints
		* Dungeon Size
		* Dungeon Tile Set
		* Enemy count
		* Enemy difficulty
		* Victory Objective
			Kill Boss
			Find item
			Escape Undetected
		* Names (Boss, Items, Characters)		
	-Room Types
		* Security
		* Hallway
		* Storage
		* Cubicals
		* Courtyards
	-Room Layout
		Given game size, compute:
			# of rooms
			number of floors
			starting room
		Use grammar		
	-Room Templates
		*Loaded at web service startup time 
			Ogmo .oel XML files scanned from shared\content\maps\folder
			For each room, store room name, tileset name, nav-mesh, portals, and any entities
	-Room Generation Algorithm
		* Given: 
			- Dungeon size enum (small, medium, large)
		* Derived:
			- NumFloors
			- Max floor extents
			- Max rooms
		* Subtractive approach
			- Start off with fully connected room set
			- Until we've fallen below a room count keep removing rooms (or failed to remove a room)
				- Find the set of rooms whose removal wouldn't cause disjoint room sets to form
				- Randomly remove a room from this set
		* Room Theming
			- Pick tile sets for each room based on contraints
				- Floor
				- monster distribution
				- loot distribution
				- portal contraints
				- proximity to other room themes
			- Seed the rooms
				- monster spawners
				- loot
Enemy AIs
* Basic Light Melee
* Basic Heavy Melee
* Turrets
* Exploding robots

Enemy Movement
* All mobs move once per player movement
* wander until the player is spotted
* Chase player until they can't see you

Energy
* Energy can be shared with friends
* Energy is spent when moving or attacking
* Need some amount of energy to escape

Energy Cells
* Owned by enemy AI initially
* Need to be hacked first to access
* Enemy AI will try to access energy tank when damaged

Experience
* XP bonus for sharing energy with friends
* XP earned for killing robots
* Can be spent to upgrade abilities
	
Energy usage
	- Depends on robot. 
	- Some can move more efficiently based on mass
	- 
	- Abilities can vary the amount of energy used
